# ECE 36200 Lab Experiments (Raspberry Pi Pico 2)

> [!CAUTION]
> **Work in progress.  Contents of these lab experiments may change closer to the start of the semester.**

Each link below takes you to the README.md file for each lab, so you don't have to click through the folders to find the page.

If you're looking for the code template associated with each lab, it (necessarily) changes every semester.  Look for the associated Piazza post made for each lab, which should be pinned, to get the corresponding GitHub Classroom link.  

If you are not currently enrolled in ECE 36200 but wish to access the code templates for academic purposes (e.g. senior design courses), contact the lab coordinator in charge.

References for the Pico 2 and parts, such as datasheets and specifications, are still being constructed.
